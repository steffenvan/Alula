# Alula - a reversible programming language

## How it works
2. Navigate into the directory Alula
3. Compile and combine the necessary files by executing `make`.
4. Simple Alula example programs are provided in `tests`.
5. Run the interpreter on a specific file using: `bin/alula FILENAME.ala`
   For instance, we can execute the factorial program: `bin/alula tests/fact.ala`
6. Input a direction in which to execute the program.
   For instance: "backwards" or "forwards". This is case insensitive. 
7. If the program expects the user to enter a value, this will be stated.
